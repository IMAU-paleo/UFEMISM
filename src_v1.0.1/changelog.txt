=================================
UFEMISM v1.0.1 changelog
=================================

Cleaned up the code.

General:
- added "USE mpi" and "IMPLICIT NONE" to all subroutines
- removed unused variables, compiling now generates almost no warnings
  (only two unused variables in the BMB routine, they will be used later in the paleo parameterisation)
- cleaned up code layout in several modules

Configuration:
- cleaned up the configuration_module
- changed config variable names from "mesh_POI_*" to "POI_*"
- changed config variable "do_eismint_experiment" to "do_benchmark_experiment",
  cleaned up exceptions for benchmark experiments in all subroutines
- removed do_thermodynamics_config
- replaced the "which_icesheets" string by four separate LOGICALs (do_NAM, do_EAS, do_GRL, do_ANT)

Netcdf:
- moved netcdf file types to their own data_types_netcdf module
- cleaned up netcdf file types:
    - added dimension ID's as variables to the type
    - renamed some of the mesh dimensions for extra clarity
- moved non-netcdf functionality for reading forcing data from netcdf_module to forcing_module

Mesh:
- removed the "semi-rectangular mesh"
- changed [nV_max, nTrimax, nconmax] to [nV_mem, nTri_mem, nC_mem]
- added nTri_mem and nC_mem as arguments to AllocateMesh, AllocateSubmesh, ExtendMesh and ExtendSubmesh
- changed all instances of "CROSS" to "CROSS2", removed "CROSS"
- renamed mesh memory allocation routines for more consistency
- made submesh alignment and merging lists to be generated procedurally
- added the different resolutions as mesh properties, removed the "mesh_config" type
- updated and cleaned the domain partitioning routines
- cleaned up mesh_derivatives_module and mesh_ArakawaC_module

Remapping:
- moved single field remapping calls to the individual submodels (ice, climate, SMB, BMB, PD)
- removed commented print statements from conservative remapping
- removed WriteMeshToTextFile calls from conservative remapping

Ice:
- moved "initialise_ice_temperature" to the thermodynamics module
- removed variables Us & Vs, added D_SIA as a diagnostic variable
- U_SIA, V_SIA and D_SIA are now remapped instead of reallocated, so that time steps
  are calculated correctly after a mesh update when the SIA is not solved.
