UFEMISM v1.1.1 changelog
=================================

Small change to the mesh-to-grid remapping code; changed the structure of the
remapping arrays from matrix-based to list-based to drastically reduce memory use.

=================================
UFEMISM v1.1 changelog
=================================

Added the climate matrix, different forcing methods, the ELRA GIA model, and the Martin/P&dC
sub-shelf melt parameterisation, the same way they are implemented in IMAU-ICE v1.1.1
Also added Lloyd's algorithm for mesh smoothing, and fixed numerous small bugs. The model can
now do complete last glacial cycle simulations, all 4 ice sheets, 16 cores, GL resolution of
10 km.

General:
- Removed the semi-rectangular meshes. Instead, a new, fast algorithm for direct mesh-to-grid
  mapping is introduced, using "pseudo-conservative" remapping. It's not as accurate as the
  mesh-to-mesh conservative remapping, but it's more robust, and it also works when the mesh
  and the grid boundaries don't coincide.
- Reinstated the ability to restart the model from a previous run.
- Added a memory use tracker. Maximum memory use over the past 100 model years is written to
  the general output file.

Mesh:
- Added Lloyd's algorithm for mesh smoothing. During each resolution iteration of mesh
  refinement, one iteration of Lloyd's algorithm is applied, moving all non-boundary vertices
  to the geometric centres of their Voronoi cells. During submesh merging, this is applied to
  all seam vertices. This results in much smoother meshes.
- Fixed a bug in create_transect so that it now works for GRL too.
- Fixed a bug where refine_mesh_geo_only didn't do anything since the triangle refinement list
  was not initialised. This resulted in a rare bug where remapping crashed due to improper
  boundary triangles (where part of the domain boundary lay inside the Voronoi cell of a
  non-boundary vertex).

Ice:
- Parallelised the SSA SOR solver using a five-colour scheme. The five-colouring is calculated
  during mesh generation using the algorithm by Williams (1985). The numerical solution of the
  SSA should now no longer depend on the number of processors, which was a probably harmless but
  endlessly annoying property of the earlier parallelisation scheme.
- Added a "reset to zero" error catchment to the SSA, similar to what was in ANICE. If this is
  done more than once during the outer loop, then the model still crashes (as no stable solution
  can be found), but this might solve the occasional SSA crashes.

Climate:
- Added the complete climate module from IMAU-ICE; the globally uniform temperature
  offset + CC / Roe&Lindzen precipitation option (de Boer et al., 2014), and the 
  PI-LGM climate matrix (Berends et al., 2018). Smoothing operations in the climate
  matrix are done on a fixed square grid (default resolution 50 km).
  
BMB:
- Added the sub-shelf melt parameterisation from IMAU-ICE (based on the temperature/depth-
  parameterisation from PISM (Martin et al., 2011) and the subtended angle/distance-to-
  open-ocean parameterisation from Pollard & DeConto, 2012). Subtended angle and distance
  to open ocean are calculated similarly to IMAU-ICE, by "looking" in 16 discrete directions.
  
GIA:
- Added the ELRA model, using a fixed square grid (default resolution of 100 km).

Forcing:
- Added d18O_inverse_dT_glob, CO2_direct, and d18O_inverse_CO2 forcing methods.
  The two inverse methods have not been tested yet.

Isotopes:
- Added the englacial d18O code from IMAU-ICE (in turn from ANICE, written by Bas de Boer).
  NOTE: this does not seem to work very well, ice sheet d18O becomes way too low. In IMAU-ICE
  (and in its predecessor ANICE) the "implicit advection model" already seems to be numerically
  unstable, but the resulting divergence is artificially suppressed by setting hard limits to
  the d18O values. Apparently this problem becomes worse in UFEMISM (though it might also just
  be a coding error somewhere).

=================================
UFEMISM v1.0.3 changelog
=================================

Some more code clean-up, some restructuring to bring it more in line with the
new IMAU-ICE, and more extensive output data support.

General:
- (re-)introduced the "semi-rectangular" ("square") mesh, for writing output
	to a regular square grid file (so that NcView can be used), and for future use
	in fast data smoothing, the ELRA GIA model, and mapping data to and from SELEN.

NetCDF output:
- Split "output" into "restart" and "help_fields", both of which contain the full mesh data.
- The user can now specify which data fields are written to the help_fields NetCDF file
	through the config. For a list of which data fields can be chosen, see the "write_help_field"
	subroutine in the "netcdf_module".
- Added "_grid" versions of both restart and help_fields, which contain the same data fields
  but mapped to a regular square grid for easy output inspection.
- A separate NetCDf file has been added for debugging. At (almost) any point in the code,
	data can be copied to the "debug" structure, which can then be written to the 
	"debug_REG.nc" output file. For example, if we want to inspect SIA ice diffusivity, we add:
	  ...
	  debug%dp_2D_Aa_01 = ice%D_SIA
	  CALL write_to_debug_file
	  ...
	The debug structure currently has the following data fields:
		int_2D_Aa_01       : 2D         (vi     ) integer          fields
		int_2D_Ac_01       : 2D         (aci    ) integer          fields
		int_2D_AaAc_01     : 2D         (ai     ) integer          fields
		dp_2D_Aa_01        : 2D         (vi     ) double precision fields
		dp_2D_Ac_01        : 2D         (aci    ) double precision fields
		dp_2D_AaAc_01      : 2D         (ai     ) double precision fields
		dp_3D_Aa_01        : 3D         (vi,zeta) double precision fields
		dp_2D_monthly_Aa_01: 2D monthly (vi,m   ) double precision fields
	The user need not worry about the mesh sizes for the four model regions, this has been
	taken care of.
	Note also that the debug file has no time dimension; when "write_to_debug_file"
	is called, all data fields in the NetCDF file are overwritten.
	Note also also that the debug data structure is always there, but "write_to_debug_file"
	only does anything if the config option "do_write_debug_data_config" is set to true.

Ice:
- restructured the SSA solver along the lines of IMAU-ICE; separate subroutines
  for calculating the effective viscosity and the sliding term, and separated the
  viscosity iteration and the linearised SOR solver.

=================================
UFEMISM v1.0.2 changelog
=================================

Cleaned up the code some more, rewrote the neighbour functions calculation,
and added support for the first MISMIP benchmark experiment.

General:
- renamed subroutines for consistency. No more capitalisation, except in case of actual
  names (Voronoi, Delaunay, etc.), and words separated by underscores
- added MISMIP_1_2 as a benchmark experiment to all routines. The semi-analytical GL flux
  is not yet included, so grounding line positions are probably still resolution-dependent,
  but the experiment itself now runs smoothly.
  
Mesh:
- removed masked neighbour functions (which were not used anywhere)
- rewrote get_neighbour_functions based on a formal derivation which has been added to the UFEMISM paper appendix

Ice:
- clarified names of different velocities
- merged the Coulomb and Weertman SSA solvers into a single routine
- changed remapping mode for Hi and Ti from 2nd to 1st order conservative

=================================
UFEMISM v1.0.1 changelog
=================================
