UFEMISM v1.0.3 changelog
=================================

Some more code clean-up, some restructuring to bring it more in line with the
new IMAU-ICE, and more extensive output data support.

General:
- (re-)introduced the "semi-rectangular" ("square") mesh, for writing output
	to a regular square grid file (so that NcView can be used), and for future use
	in fast data smoothing, the ELRA GIA model, and mapping data to and from SELEN.

NetCDF output:
- Split "output" into "restart" and "help_fields", both of which contain the full mesh data.
- The user can now specify which data fields are written to the help_fields NetCDF file
	through the config. For a list of which data fields can be chosen, see the "write_help_field"
	subroutine in the "netcdf_module".
- Added "_grid" versions of both restart and help_fields, which contain the same data fields
  but mapped to a regular square grid for easy output inspection.
- A separate NetCDf file has been added for debugging. At (almost) any point in the code,
	data can be copied to the "debug" structure, which can then be written to the 
	"debug_REG.nc" output file. For example, if we want to inspect SIA ice diffusivity, we add:
	  ...
	  debug%dp_2D_Aa_01 = ice%D_SIA
	  CALL write_to_debug_file
	  ...
	The debug structure currently has the following data fields:
		int_2D_Aa_01       : 2D         (vi     ) integer          fields
		int_2D_Ac_01       : 2D         (aci    ) integer          fields
		int_2D_AaAc_01     : 2D         (ai     ) integer          fields
		dp_2D_Aa_01        : 2D         (vi     ) double precision fields
		dp_2D_Ac_01        : 2D         (aci    ) double precision fields
		dp_2D_AaAc_01      : 2D         (ai     ) double precision fields
		dp_3D_Aa_01        : 3D         (vi,zeta) double precision fields
		dp_2D_monthly_Aa_01: 2D monthly (vi,m   ) double precision fields
	The user need not worry about the mesh sizes for the four model regions, this has been
	taken care of.
	Note also that the debug file has no time dimension; when "write_to_debug_file"
	is called, all data fields in the NetCDF file are overwritten.
	Note also also that the debug data structure is always there, but "write_to_debug_file"
	only does anything if the config option "do_write_debug_data_config" is set to true.

Ice:
- restructured the SSA solver along the lines of IMAU-ICE; separate subroutines
  for calculating the effective viscosity and the sliding term, and separated the
  viscosity iteration and the linearised SOR solver.

=================================
UFEMISM v1.0.2 changelog
=================================

Cleaned up the code some more, rewrote the neighbour functions calculation,
and added support for the first MISMIP benchmark experiment.

General:
- renamed subroutines for consistency. No more capitalisation, except in case of actual
  names (Voronoi, Delaunay, etc.), and words separated by underscores
- added MISMIP_1_2 as a benchmark experiment to all routines. The semi-analytical GL flux
  is not yet included, so grounding line positions are probably still resolution-dependent,
  but the experiment itself now runs smoothly.
  
Mesh:
- removed masked neighbour functions (which were not used anywhere)
- rewrote get_neighbour_functions based on a formal derivation which has been added to the UFEMISM paper appendix

Ice:
- clarified names of different velocities
- merged the Coulomb and Weertman SSA solvers into a single routine
- changed remapping mode for Hi and Ti from 2nd to 1st order conservative

=================================
UFEMISM v1.0.1 changelog
=================================

Cleaned up the code.

General:
- added "USE mpi" and "IMPLICIT NONE" to all subroutines
- removed unused variables, compiling now generates almost no warnings
  (only two unused variables in the BMB routine, they will be used later in the paleo parameterisation)
- cleaned up code layout in several modules

Configuration:
- cleaned up the configuration_module
- changed config variable names from "mesh_POI_*" to "POI_*"
- changed config variable "do_eismint_experiment" to "do_benchmark_experiment",
  cleaned up exceptions for benchmark experiments in all subroutines
- removed do_thermodynamics_config
- replaced the "which_icesheets" string by four separate LOGICALs (do_NAM, do_EAS, do_GRL, do_ANT)

Netcdf:
- moved netcdf file types to their own data_types_netcdf module
- cleaned up netcdf file types:
    - added dimension ID's as variables to the type
    - renamed some of the mesh dimensions for extra clarity
- moved non-netcdf functionality for reading forcing data from netcdf_module to forcing_module

Mesh:
- removed the "semi-rectangular mesh"
- changed [nV_max, nTrimax, nconmax] to [nV_mem, nTri_mem, nC_mem]
- added nTri_mem and nC_mem as arguments to AllocateMesh, AllocateSubmesh, ExtendMesh and ExtendSubmesh
- changed all instances of "CROSS" to "CROSS2", removed "CROSS"
- renamed mesh memory allocation routines for more consistency
- made submesh alignment and merging lists to be generated procedurally
- added the different resolutions as mesh properties, removed the "mesh_config" type
- updated and cleaned the domain partitioning routines
- cleaned up mesh_derivatives_module and mesh_ArakawaC_module

Remapping:
- moved single field remapping calls to the individual submodels (ice, climate, SMB, BMB, PD)
- removed commented print statements from conservative remapping
- removed WriteMeshToTextFile calls from conservative remapping

Ice:
- moved "initialise_ice_temperature" to the thermodynamics module
- removed variables Us & Vs, added D_SIA as a diagnostic variable
